About Me:
Hey my name is Vedaant and I am a computer science major here at UT. I have done various internships and projects in different areas of computer science including IT, Data Analytics, and Software Engineering. I'm a huge sports fan and actually work for the UT Vols Baseball team in their analytics and scouting department. I'm familiar with a bunch of languages such as C++, Python, SQL, R, C, C#, Java, Tableau but the first 3 are definitely the ones I'm most comfortable with.`
