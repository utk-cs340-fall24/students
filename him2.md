Name: Avery Im
NETID: him2
GitHub Username: severe ninja
Major: Computer Science

# BACKGROUND
I am a Korean American that was born and raised in Nashville, TN. I actually majored in psychology before I made the switch to computer science. I have never really been interested in the actual hard concepts of programming more than the theoretical and mathematical aspects of CS.

# HOBBIES
My hobbies include the following (in order):
1. playing video games
2. sleeping
3. hanging out with friends individually
4. cooking

# LANGUAGES
The languages I am familiar in are Python, Java, C++, and I barely know some C#. I am definitely not good at it, but I can recognize it.

I am really into playing [Overwatch](https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/) and have been recently watching their esports World Series.
